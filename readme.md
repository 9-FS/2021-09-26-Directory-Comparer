## 1. Overview

Compares given directory's contents and lists the entries that are unique to their respective folders.  
Limitations:

- It does not use recursion, so only the immediate child entries are compared.
- It only compares the entry names, not their actual type or content or anything else.

May be useful for manually syncing 2 folders.
